# t-SNE
t-SNE is similar to PCA in that they both reduce high-dimensional features into low-dimensional features. However, the difference between t-SNE and PCA is that after using t-SNE, the inner cluster distance will be increased and inter clusters distance will shrink. And t-SNE's time complexity is much more than PCA.
